    "#### Overview of the algorithm\n",
    "  \n",
    "The dynamic factor variance-covariance model, [DFVCM](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview...applicationId=AWSMPContessa), is to make multi-step forecast of large variance-covariance matrix of large set of observed time-series, when the time-series are influenced by both (a) dynamic history of a set of unobserved factors commonly affecting all or many of the time-series and (b) dynamic histories of hidden components affecting idiosyncratic components of individual time-series.  \n",
    "\n",
    "DFVCM applies [LMDFM](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview...applicationId=AWSMPContessa) algorithm to estimate and forecast volatility of common factors of all time-series. Then, DFVCM applies [YWpcAR](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview...applicationId=AWSMPContessa) algorithm to estimate and forecast volatility of idiosyncratic components of individual time-series.\n",
    "  \n",
    "[LMDFM](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview...applicationId=AWSMPContessa) applies dynamic principal components analysis (DPCA) with 1 or 2-dimensional discrete Fourier transforms (1/2D-DTFs). [YWpcAR](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview...applicationId=AWSMPContessa) applies principal components analysis on Yule-Walker equation of individual idiosyncratic component.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Therefore, the DFVCM algorithm can estimate influences of longer histories of unobserved common factors and hidden idiosyncratic components. The algorithm accommodates wider ranges of values of model learning parameters. The wider ranges can further enhance the power of machine learning.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Current version of the [DFVCM](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview...applicationId=AWSMPContessa) algorithm estimates and/or forecasts (in multi-steps): (a) estimated matrix of factor loadings, (b) forecasted variance of common factors, (c) forecasted variance of idiosyncratic components, (d) forecasted variance of individual time-series, (e) forecasted variance of weighted aggregation of multiple time-series, and (f) forecasted variance-covariance matrix of multiple observed time-series. Other estimates and/or forecasts (such as forecasted auto-covariance matrixes) can be added in the future releases."
