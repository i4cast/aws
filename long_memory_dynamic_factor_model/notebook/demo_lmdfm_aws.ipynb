    "1. multi-step forecasts of multivariate (vector) time-series, and  \n",

    "  \n",
    "The LMDFM model assumes that the large set of time-series are influenced by evolution histories of a number of unobserved factors commonly affecting all or many of the time-series. LMDFM is estimated by an implementation of dynamic principal components analysis (DPCA), reviewed by Doz and Fuleky (2020), with 2-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (2D-DFT). LMDFM algorithm can estimate the influences of longer histories of common factors and avoid over-fitting. The algorithm accommodates wider ranges of values of model learning parameters. The wider ranges can further enhance the power of machine learning.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Current version of the LMDFM algorithm estimates: (a) dynamic factor loadings matrixes, (b) vector autoregressive (VAR) coefficients of dynamic factor scores, (c) multi-step forecasts of the factor scores and of the observed time-series, (d) impulse response of the time-series to several simultaneous shocks, and (e) multi-step forecasts of variance-covariance matrix of the factor scores and of the observed time-series; etc. Other estimates will be added in the future releases.
