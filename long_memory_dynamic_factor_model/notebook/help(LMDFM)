 |  LMDFM Method
 |  ------------
 |
 |  Acronyms
 |      LMDFM: long-memory dynamic factor model
 |      DFT: discrete Fourier transform
 |      C2D-DFT: conjugate 2D-DFT
 |      PCA : principal components analysis
 |      SPCA : spectral PCA
 |
 |  Methodolgy
 |      * Non-stationary LMDFM (long-memory dynamic
 |        factor model) is estimated by an execution
 |        of spectral principal components analysis
 |        (SPCA) reviewed by Doz and Fuleky (2020).
 |      * A non-stationary SPCA approach is a 4-step
 |        method: (1) conjugate two-dimensional
 |        discrete Fourier transform (C2D-DFT), (2)
 |        spectral PCA, (3) inverse C2D-DFT, and (4)
 |        additional PCA, as summarized as follows.
 |      * Estimating variance-covariance matrixes
 |        (VCMs) and vector autocovariance matrixes
 |        (ACMs) of observed vector (i.e. multiple)
 |        time-series.
 |      * Combining VCMs/ACMs by applying C2D-DFT
 |        on VCMs/ACMs.
 |      * Referring resulted matrixes by C2D-DFT
 |        as spectral density matrixes (SDMs).
 |      * Estimating spectral principal components
 |        (SPCs) of on-diagonal SDMs, and SPCA
 |        decompositions of off-diagonal SDMs.
 |      * Applying inverse C2D-DFT: converting
 |        SPC representations of SDMs into dimension-
 |        reduced representations of original VCMs
 |        and ACMs.
 |      * Estimating principal components (PCs)
 |        of VCMs and PCA decompositions of ACMs.
 |      * This way, PCs of VCMs contain dynamic
 |        information in all VCMs and ACMs.
 |      * Dynamic factor loadings X(j|p1), VAR
 |        coefficients A(k|p2) of factor scores,
 |        factor filter coefficients S(j), and
 |        DFM-based VAR coefficients are estimated
 |        by principal components of VCMs.
 |
 |  Benefits
 |      * Avoiding over-fitting when estimating long-
 |        memory dynamic factor model of large order
