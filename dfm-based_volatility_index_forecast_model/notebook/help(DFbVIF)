 |  Notation
 |      "Underlying time-series"
 |          An underlying time-series, underlying
 |          a given volatility index, is a time-
 |          series of (e.g. percentage or logarithmic)
 |          changes in price/value/index, with the
 |          volatility index value representing expected
 |          volatility level of the underlying time-
 |          series, expected at a specified future time
 |
 |  Underlying vector time-series y_und(t)
 |      y_und(t) : h underlying time-series (of
 |          changes in prices/values/indexes)
 |          underlying h volatility index vi(t),
 |          with value of vi(t) showing expected
 |          future volatility vector of y_und(t)
 |
 |  info-enhancing vector time-series y_info(t)
 |      y_info(t) : multiple other time-series
 |          (of changes in prices/values/indexes)
 |          dynamically correlated with some or
 |          all underlying time-series y_und(t),
 |          serving as information-enhancing
 |          time-series to enhance predictive
 |          power of model forecast
 |
 |  DFM-input time-series y(t)
 |      y(t) : vector time-series of n-by-1 combined
 |          vector y = [ y_und', y_info' ]' to serve
 |          as input data of dynamic factor model
 |          (DFM)
 |      n : number of observed time-series in DFM-
 |          input vector time-series y(t)
 |      c : n-by-1 mean vector of DFM-input vector
 |          time-series y(t)
 |
 |  Parameter values
 |      c = 0 : assuming y(t) is zero-mean DFM-

 |  Dynamic VI forecast
 |  -------------------
 |
 |  Methodology of dynamic VI forecast
 |      * Values of volatility indexes, VI(t), represent
 |        expected volatility levels of underlying
 |        time-series, y_und(t), expected at a specified
 |        future time
 |      * Volatility indexes are closely related to
 |        forecasted volatilities of underlying time-
 |        series
 |      * Volatilities of DFM-input vector time-
 |        series y(t), can be effectively modeled and
 |        forecasted by dynamic factor models (DFMs)
 |      * DFM-input vector time-series include both
 |        (1) price time-series underlying volatility
 |        indexes and (2) other information-enhancing
 |        time-series
 |      * DFM-input vector time-series can have much
 |        more information, and therefore much more
 |        predictive power, than underlying time-series
 |        alone
 |      * DFbVIF uses DFM volatility model on DFM-input
 |        vector time-series to forecast volatility
 |        indexes
 |      * Volatility index forecasts by DFbVIF include:
 |        (1) UVF forecasts and (2) QAR forecasts
 |      * (and 3, FUTURE development, by TSF forecasts)
 |      * With DFM modeling, DFbVIF is able to attribute
 |        volatility index forecasts to dynamic sources
 |        of volatility, e.g. variance of common factors
 |        and idiosyncratic UDCs, autocovariance of
 |        factors and UDCs, and variance of prediction/
 |        residual errors
