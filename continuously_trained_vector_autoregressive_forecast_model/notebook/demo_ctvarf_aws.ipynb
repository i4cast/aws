    "#### Overview of the algorithm\n",
    "  \n",
    "The continuously trained vector autoregressive forecast (CTVARF) model is developed to forecast large sets of time-series when the time-series are influenced by both (a) evolution histories of a set of unobserved factors commonly affecting all or many of the time-series and (b) evolution histories of hidden components affecting idiosyncratic components of the individual time-series.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "By applying objective data-driven constraints, the CTVARF algorithm can estimate the influences of longer histories of the unobserved common factors and hidden idiosyncratic components. The algorithm accommodates wider ranges of values of model learning parameters. The wider ranges can further enhance the power of machine learning.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "At first, vector time-series forecasts are made on a \"base case\" where all time-series are standardized in time domain. The base case forecasts are then rescaled and/or adjusted into forecasts according to requested specifications.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Current version of the CTVARF algorithm estimates: (a) forecasts of common and idiosyncratic components of the base case forecasts\n",
    "(b) the vector time-series forecasts according to requested specification, (c) forecasts per unit of variability (in standard deviation) of time-series, and (d) goodness scores of the vector time-series forecasts, given a set of evaluation metrics. Other estimates will be added in the future releases.  "
